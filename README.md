# Face Anonymizer using Python with OpenCV, MediaPipe, and argparse üôàüôà

## Introduction ü•∑üèΩ

Face Anonymizer using Python with OpenCV, MediaPipe, and argparse is a versatile project that allows you to protect individuals' privacy in images and videos by anonymizing their faces. This tool is useful for various purposes, including research, content creation, and maintaining privacy in sensitive media.

The project combines several powerful libraries and tools:

- **OpenCV**: A widely-used computer vision library that provides tools for image and video manipulation.
- **MediaPipe**: A framework for building various perception solutions, including face detection and facial landmark estimation.
- **argparse**: A Python library for parsing command-line arguments, making it easy to customize the anonymization process.

## Features üöÄ

- **Face Detection**: Detect faces in images or videos using MediaPipe's facial recognition models.
- **Face Landmarks**: Identify facial landmarks to precisely locate facial features.
- **Anonymization**: Anonymize faces by blurring, pixelating, or replacing them with emojis, masks, or custom images.
- **Batch Processing**: Anonymize multiple images or frames from videos in one go.
- **Customization**: Use command-line arguments to customize the anonymization method, output format, and other settings.

## Usage ‚ú®

1. **Input and Output**:

   Use the `--input` argument to specify the input image or video file and the `--output` argument to set the output filename. If no output is provided, the anonymized result will be displayed on the screen.

2. **Anonymization Method**:

   Customize the anonymization method using the `--method` argument. Options include `blur`, `pixelate`, `emoji`, `mask`, and `custom`.

3. **Customization**:

   Depending on the chosen anonymization method, you may have additional arguments to fine-tune the anonymization process. Refer to the project documentation for details.

4. **Batch Processing**:

   To anonymize multiple files in one go, use the `--batch` argument followed by a directory path containing the input files.
